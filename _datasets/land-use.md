title: Present Land Use in BC
organization: BC Gov
notes: This layer represents Land use polygons as determined by a combination of analytic techniques, mostly using Landsat 5 image mosaics . BTM 1 was done on a federal satellite image base that was only accurate to about 250m. The images were geo-corrected, not ortho-corrected, so there is distortion in areas of high relief.
