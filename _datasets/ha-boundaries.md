notes: The HAs are a mutually exclusive and exhaustive classification of the land area in BC. HAs are contiguous (land area is geographically adjacent) and fit within an existing geographical hierarchy, e.g., cannot violate lower-level geography boundaries such as the Health Service Delivery Areas (HSDA) and Local Health Area (LHA).
