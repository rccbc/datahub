title: Urgent and Primary Care Centres in BC
organization: HealthLinkBC
notes: Urgent and Primary Care Centres provide better access to same-day, urgent, non-emergency health care, including in the evening and on weekends. They provide an alternative to visiting emergency departments for issues that do not need to be seen in a hospital. For example, patients who require medical attention within 12 to 24 hours for something like a sprain, minor cut or burn can visit an Urgent and Primary Care Centre.
