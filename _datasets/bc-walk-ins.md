title: Walk-in Clinics in BC
organization: HealthLinkBC
notes: Programs in BC that provide walk-in treatment services for people who have minor illnesses or injuries that do not require a visit to a hospital emergency department or an urgent care facility. These programs are generally specialized practices set up by groups of physicians operating within the provincial-territorial heath system who are available for patients that do not have family physicians or who need medical treatment and-or diagnosis at times when their family physician is not available. In some areas, a walk-in clinic may rotate between the clinics of different physicians. Some programs, mainly in major metropolitan areas, may operate on a 24-hour basis but all tend to be open for some or all evenings and weekends
